I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University, working under the mentorship of Dr. Francesca Dominici in the National Studies on Air Pollution and Health ([NSAPH](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nsaph/')) group. Before joining Harvard, I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of Florida, where I was mentored by Dr. Joseph Antonelli. My research interests lie in causal inference, flexible Bayesian models, and more broadly, environmental statistics.
