I am a 4th-year Statistics Ph.D. student at the University of Florida. I am currently working with Dr. Joseph Antonelli. My research interests lie in causal inference, high-dimensional modeling, flexible Bayesian models, and more broadly, environmental statistics. Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my B.S. in Applied Statistics at Konkuk University in 2019.
